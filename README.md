# Capone-CS
Eclipse plug-in to build product lines of graphical modelling languages

## Case Studies

To show the usefulness of our tool we implemented 4 language of families of Networking DSL, Statecharts, Petri nets and Factories.

### Networking

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in [capone-examples/networking.visualization](https://github.com/antoniogarmendia/capone-graphical-pl/tree/main/capone-examples/networking.visualization). The folder [generated-graphical-environments/Networking](https://github.com/antoniogarmendia/capone-graphical-pl/tree/main/generated-graphical-environments/Networking) contains the generated projects of the
graphical editor of product5. A model example of produc5 can be found in [product00005](https://github.com/antoniogarmendia/capone-graphical-pl/blob/main/example-of-models/Networking/networking.pl.models/product00005.networkingpl)

### Statecharts

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/StateMachines.pl.visualization. The folder generated-graphical-environments/StateCharts contains the example of the product43.

### Petri nets

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/PetriNets.pl.visualization. The folder generated-graphical-environments/PetriNets contains the example of the product58.

### Factories

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/factories.pl.visualization. The folder generated-graphical-environments/Factories contains the example of the product0.
