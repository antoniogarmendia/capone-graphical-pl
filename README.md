# Capone-CS
Eclipse plug-in to build product lines of graphical modelling languages

## Case Studies

To show the usefulness of our tool we implemented 4 language of families of Networking DSL, Statecharts, Petri nets and Factories.

### Networking

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/networking.visualization. The folder generated-graphical-environments/Networking contains the example of the product5.

### Statecharts

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/StateMachines.pl.visualization. 

### Petri nets

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/PetriNets.pl.visualization. 

### Factories

The project that contains the modules of the product line is in capone-examples/factories.pl.visualization. The folder generated-graphical-environments/Factories contains the example of the product0.
